This is the control program for the MINERvA light-injection box.  It relies on an RS-232 (serial) interface.
It only works on UNIX platforms because the serial interface varies wildly from platform to platform.

For it to work correctly, you must:
 - Compile the binary.  You need GNU-compliant 'make' installed for this to work.
   Just type 'make' in the root directory of the package.
 - Put the resultatnbinary ("LIBoxIO") somewhere.  I'd recommend /usr/bin, 
   so that it's in your PATH, but it doesn't really matter.
 - Copy the configuration file LIBoxIO.conf to /etc (or if you want to put it somewhere else,
   be sure you always pass the --config-file parameter to the executable)
 - Copy the scripts folder ("LIBoxScripts") to some folder where you want to keep them.
   (I recommend /usr/share/LIBoxScripts, but again, it doesn't really matter.  What DOES matter is
    that you change the value in LIBoxIO.conf so that the binary knows where it is.)
 - Be sure that whichever user you use to run the program has permissions to both read and write
   to the serial port device that you specify in the configuration file!
   (Run 'ls -l [your serial device]' to see who has permission.)
