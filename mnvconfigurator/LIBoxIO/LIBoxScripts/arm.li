# default script for preparing the LI box for operation.
# place single commands on each line.
# if you want the program to verify that the box responds with a particular response,
# put that on the same line, separated from the command by a colon (command:response).
# for example:
#  aA:z

aA
aEa
aD7
aH0_2
aI2_0
