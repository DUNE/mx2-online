========================================

This document briefly describes the configuration and usage of the MINERvA run
control software contained in this package.  More extensive documentation on
its usage in the control room is maintained on the MINERvA wiki at the
following URLs (from the MINERvA detector manual):

1. PREREQUISITES
  * Python >=2.6 but < 3.0 
    mnvruncontrol is a Python application.  It requires a Python 2 version
    >= 2.6 (but it isn't Python-3.0 compatible).  If you need to install
    Python, visit www.python.org.
  
  * wxPython >= 2.8.10
    The graphical framework of mnvruncontrol (and some of its event model)
    depends heavily on the Python implementation of wxWidgets.  You can get
    wxPython from www.wxpython.org.
  
  * pySerial >= 2.4 (only when light injection is needed)
    The light injection box uses an RS-232 (i.e., serial) interface.  The best
    Python serial library I found (there isn't one built in, strangely) is
    pySerial, which you can get from pyserial.sourceforge.net.  Follow its
    instructions to install either in the default location or in a location
    that you include in the environment variable $PYTHONPATH.

  * MINERvA DAQ software
    Since mnvruncontrol is designed to stitch together the parts of the MINERvA
    DAQ, you will need to have a recent version of mnvdaq installed and properly
    configured.  See its README files for instructions on how to build/configure
    it.
    
  * MINERvA slow control software (readout nodes only)
    For proper configuration of readout nodes, a recent version of
    mnvconfigurator/SlowControl should be installed (as well as the __init__.py
    that lives in the mnvconfigurator root).  Its installation location must
    be included in the $PYTHONPATH environment variable (on the readout nodes).
    
  Once you have all of these you should be able to install the mnvruncontrol
  folder anywhere you like (but see the first bullet under section 2 below).
  
2. CONFIGURATION
  * For the application to work as designed, you MUST include the folder into
    which you install mnvruncontrol as part of the $PYTHONPATH environment
    variable.  For example, if the folder containing the run control files is
       /work/software/mnvruncontrol,
    you must add 
       /work/software
    to the $PYTHONPATH.
    Also note that the folder that contains this README as well as the other
    files must be named "mnvruncontrol".
    
    DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP OR THE RUN CONTROL WILL NOT WORK.
    
  * The run control is fairly configurable, but it will want to store its root
    configuration file in a folder called "/work/conditions".  If such a folder
    does not exist, you have a choice: (a) create it, (b) edit the file
    backend/Defaults.py and change the variables CONFIG_DB_LOCATION and
    CONFIG_DB_NAME to suit your preferences, or (c) place a file with the name
    "run_control_config.db" (it can be empty) in the same directory as any of 
    the run control files you want to run.
    
    For your sanity I recommend option (a) (or if that's not possible, (b)).
    
  * The run control expects a certain set of parameters set by the DAQ to be
    in its environment ($DAQROOT, $ETHOME, etc.) when started.  This environment
    can be obtained by sourcing the script 'setupdaqenv.sh', which lives in the
    mnvdaq package.
  
  * Most other configuration of the run control can be done through the program
    RunControlConfiguration.py, which lives in mnvruncontrol/frontend.  You
    should run this program on every node you intend to use some run control
    software on, because all the run control components use the same central
    configuration system for simplicity of maintenance.

3. USAGE NOTES
  * To start the run control, first source the "setupdaqenv.sh" contained in
    mnvdaq.  After that then you can start the run control.  For example,
    on mnvonlinemaster:
    
    source /work/software/mnvonline/mnvdaq/setupdaqenv.sh
    cd /work/software/mnvruncontrol/frontend
    python RunControl.py
  
  * Most errors that the run control might encounter are handled via graphical
    pop-up windows informing the user what has happened and suggesting a course
    of action to resove them.  Nevertheless, occasionally the RC crashes in such
    a way that the error wasn't caught; in these cases, a "traceback" will be
    printed out to the console from which the RC was started.  Including the
    traceback in any communication to the maintainer of the code is EXTREMELY
    helpful and is requested as a matter of practice.

4. HACKING
  For more detailed notes about the guts of the run control, consult the file
  'HACKING' (included in the root of the mnvruncontrol package).
