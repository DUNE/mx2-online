========================================

This document briefly summarizes the changes from version to version
of the MINERvA run control software.  I didn't think to start it
until most of the way through v4, so it's a bit skimpy below there...

v5r0     (Beta version.)  Massive overhaul of run control system:
         - DataAcquisitionManager is now a SERVER process (a Dispatcher
           like the others).  Start the other Dispatchers on the
           appropriate nodes first.  It can run the DAQ with any number
           of frontend clients (including 0).
         - Frontend CLIENTs now are run locally on the machine where
           they are to be used (instead of being X-forwarded via SSH).
         - A multitude of adjustments were made to the thread
           architecture, the configuration, and the event model to
           support this new design.  They are too numerous to detail
           here (see the CVS logs if you are really interested).

v4r15    Now expects any LI boxes to be attached to the readout nodes
         and gives them instructions accordingly.

v4r14    MonitorDispatcher now e-mails users specified in Configuration
         if a DST-making job fails.

v4r13    - Compatibility update for asynchronous DAQ (mnvdaq >= v7r5):
           * Readout dispatcher reports on sentinel frame status to main node.
           * Sends SIGTERM to event builder process if no sentinel coming.
           * Readout dispatcher now reads SAM file to get gate count
             (since event builder lags behind DAQ in asynchronous mode)
             and reports to main node for display.
         - PMT HV notification alert in main window is now dismissed
           automatically when user selects "continue" or "close" in pop-up
           window.
         - HW loading is now always initiated on the next run following a HW
           error, irrespective of whether the last run series and this one
           have the same configuration
. 
.
.
v4       Added MTest beamline DAQ dispatcher/node architecture.

v3       Now handles multi-node DAQ operations.

v2       Added remote node functionality via socket communcation.

v1       First working release of mnvruncontrol.  Single-node only.
