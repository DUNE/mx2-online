========================================

This document briefly summarizes the changes from version to version
of the MINERvA run control software.  I didn't think to start it
until most of the way through v4, so it's a bit skimpy below there...

v4r15    Now expects any LI boxes to be attached to the readout nodes
         and gives them instructions accordingly.

v4r14    MonitorDispatcher now e-mails users specified in Configuration
         if a DST making job fails.

v4r13    - Compatibility update for asynchronous DAQ (mnvdaq >= v7r5):
           * Readout dispatcher reports on sentinel frame status to main node.
           * Sends SIGTERM to event builder process if no sentinel coming.
           * Readout dispatcher now reads SAM file to get gate count
             (since event builder lags behind DAQ in asynchronous mode)
             and reports to main node for display.
         - PMT HV notification alert in main window is now dismissed
           automatically when user selects "continue" or "close" in pop-up
           window.
         - HW loading is now always initiated on the next run following a HW
           error, irrespective of whether the last run series and this one
           have the same configuration
. 
.
.
v4       Added MTest beamline DAQ dispatcher/node architecture.

v3       Now handles multi-node DAQ operations.

v2       Added remote node functionality via socket communcation.

v1       First working release of mnvruncontrol.  Single-node only.
